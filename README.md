# hello-com-rust

Rust library for simplifying COM/ActiveX using windows crate.  Will simplify getting, putting,
and calling methods on COM objects.

Also, there were no samples for the windows crate and almost no resources online.  This repo
was just a discovery process, so use this lib at your own risk.
